    "text": "a. Forced alignment and text grids\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Visual of how hand-correction of text grids relates to other lab tasks\n\n\nIn the WISC Lab we have audio recordings of children with typical speech development and with speech and motor impairments due to Cerebral Palsy. In these recordings the child is repeating words and phrases from the Test of Children’s Speech (the TOCS, as we know them by). Examples include phrases like “Cowboy boots” and “Put all the toys away”. We then use the recordings of these phrases to calculate articulation rate, speech sound accuracy, as well as to get measures of how intelligible the child is. Figure 3 below shows what it looks like if we open the file “The sign says keep out” all by itself in the program Praat.\nWe can see the waveform (top) and the spectrogram (bottom), but what if we want to keep track of how long different words and sounds are?\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - Recording of “The sign says keep out” when opened in Praat.\n\n\nMarking the start and end points of sounds and words in a recording is useful for a variety of research purposes. However, we can’t make marks/annotations directly in the sound file, so to do this we need to create a separate file that stores all of the locations of events like the start and end of a word or sound.\nThe tool that we use to create a separate document containing annotations and labels for different words and sounds is called a forced aligner. A forced aligner takes an audio file (typically a .wav file) and a transcription of what was said in the audio file (usually a .txt or .lab file) and uses speech recognition technology to create a new file called a text grid that is designed to be paired with the audio file. The text grid has boundaries and labels indicating the locations of the words and phonemes in the audio file.\nA text grid file is associated with a given audio file and has moveable boundaries and labels to note the occurrence of certain events (like the beginning and end of a vowel) that may be useful for research. Figure 4 below shows what that same audio file (“The sign says keep out”) looks like when opened together with the text grid that was created for that sound file by Montreal Forced Aligner. The text grids we create for the lab contain separate tiers for words, sounds, and the sentence containing them. Each tier has intervals with vertical boundaries separating words and sounds. These files (the text grid and wav file) can be used for automated retrieval of acoustic data such as duration of a word/sound, formant frequencies of vowels, and other variables of interest.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - “The sign says keep out” when the recording is opened together with a fully annotated “text grid”.\n\n\nWe can open these text grids along with the audio file in a program called Praat (Dutch for “speech”, sounds like “praht” - /pra:t/). When the text grids and audio files are paired together in Praat, it is now easier and quicker for us to make measurements because we have labels for each word and sound, as well as the time intervals during which these events occur."

    "text": "b. Hand-correction\nForced aligners are not perfect, however. When a forced aligner creates a text grid, the initial placement of boundaries for words and sounds may not be accurate. During the hand-correction process, you will be adjusting boundaries in text grids that have been automatically created using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA for short). When Montreal Forced Aligner pairs a typed transcription with an audio file, it frequently does a pretty good job of putting boundaries in place, and the boundaries might just need some slight shifting, or even no adjustment at all. Other times, the boundaries are placed at the wrong times, and even placed at a time at which an entirely different word is being produced. These boundaries require hand-correction.\nYour job is to ensure that those boundaries have been placed where they ought to go. This document that you are reading now is intended to help you understand what you are looking at when you look at audio recordings in Praat (or any program that shows a spectrogram and waveform), and it is designed to be a guide for decision-making when boundary placement is difficult to determine.\nFigure 5 shows a text grid prior to hand-correction, and Figure 6 shows the same text grid but with black and gold squares overlaid on the image to show where the word boundaries actually are. Figure 7 then shows what the text grid looks like after hand-correction.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - Force-aligned Text Grid of cowboy boots that has not yet been hand-corrected. The boundaries for cowboy were placed too soon, and boundaries for boots include the -boy part of cowboy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Force-aligned Text Grid of cowboy boots that has not yet been hand-corrected. Black and gold squares show where the words actually occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Hand-corrected text grid of cowboy boots. We can now see how the boundaries in the text grid line up with where the box shapes indicated that the word were."

Formants are frequency regions that are emphasized by a given vocal tract configuration, and differ from vowel to vowel. The screenshot below shows the word TOYS, with the vowel OY1 highlighted. Note the formant structure and how one of the formants rises as the diphthong changes from /o/ to /i/.\n\n\nLiquids\nL often looks similar to vowels, with highest energy concentrated in lower frequencies. Here L in Figure 10 contrasts against the IY1 and AE1 vowels on either side.\nR\nLike L, R looks much like a vowel, but a clearly articulated R will almost always have a third formant that dips down to 3,000 Hz or lower. Notice the transition that the third band makes from AO1 to R in OR below (the red arrow points to it).\n\n\nNasals\nNasals will generally show patterns similar to vowels and liquids, but will often have a “hollow” look compared to a vowel, as in the highlighted portion below in the word MAKE.\n\n\nFricatives\nS, SH (sheep), Z, F, V, TH (think), DH (this)\nNoise - Fricatives have noise that is generally distributed throughout the frequency spectrum.\nS, SH, and Z are typically longer and with very apparent noise in higher frequency ranges.\nTH, DH, F and V are often less pronounced, but if clearly articulated will have visible noise in the spectrogram. Generally shorter than S and SH.\nDH sometimes appears similar to D\n\n\nStops\nP, T, K, B, D, G\nBurst – Stops will often be characterized by a thin dark line across the frequency range. This is from the release of the consonant (the “burst”).\nVoiceless stops in English will have a longer period of noisy energy after the burst, and for voiced consonants, the vowel will usually start immediately after the burst."

There may be a small “silent” period before the stop, which is the closure duration of the stop/affricate, and not actually a pause.\n\nFigure 54 – Boundary placement in Fricative &gt; Stop/Affricate transitions.

Phonation is shutting off due to laryngeal status of following consonant.\nNote that this makes boundary placement in vowel &gt; consonant transitions completely analogous to many transitions from voiceless consonants to vowels (e.g. when there is heavy aspiration on a sound like K, but we start the vowel at onset of phonation for the vowel, even though the vocal tract may already be positioned for the vowel during the aspiration).\n\nFigure 72 - Here the phonation of the vowel ends suddenly as the glottis positions for S, resulting in H-like pre-aspiration leading into the F"

    "text": "1. Introduction\n\na. Forced alignment and text grids\nIn the WISC Lab we have audio recordings of children with both typical speech development and speech and motor impairments due to Cerebral Palsy. In these recordings the child is repeating words and phrases from the Test of Children’s Speech (TOCS). Examples include phrases like “Cowboy boots” and “put all the toys away.” Recordings are used to calculate articulation rate, speech sound accuracy, and measures of how intelligible a child is. Figure 1 shows what it looks like when we open the file “The sign says keep out” in Praat.\nWe can see the waveform (top) and the spectrogram (bottom), but what if we want to keep track of how long different words and sounds are?\n\n\nFigure 1 - Recording of “the sign says keep out” in Praat.\n\n\n\nMarking the start and end points of sounds and words in a recording is useful for a variety of research purposes. However, we can’t annotate sound files directly, so we need to create a separate file that stores all of the locations of events like the start and end of a word or sound.\nThe tool that we use to create a separate document containing annotations and labels for different words and sounds is called a forced aligner. A forced aligner takes an audio file (typically a .wav file) and a transcription of what was said in the audio file (usually a .txt or .lab file) and uses speech recognition technology to create a new file called a text grid that is designed to be paired with the audio file. The text grid has boundaries and labels indicating the locations of the words and phonemes in the audio file.\nA text grid file is associated with a given audio file and has moveable boundaries and labels to note the occurrence of certain events (like the beginning and end of a vowel) that may be useful for research. Figure 2 shows the phrase from Figure 1 when opened with the text grid produced by the Montreal Forced Aligner. The text grids we create for the lab contain separate tiers for words, sounds, and the sentence containing them. Each tier has intervals with vertical boundaries separating words and sounds. These files (the .TextGrid and .wav file) can be used for automated retrieval of acoustic data such as the duration of a word or sound, formant frequencies of vowels, and other variables of interest.\n\n\nFigure 2 - “The sign says keep out” when the recording is opened together with a fully annotated text grid.\n\n\n\nWe can open these text grids along with the audio file in a program called Praat (Dutch for “speech”, sounds like “praht” - /pra:t/). When the text grids and audio files are paired together in Praat, it is now easier and quicker for us to make measurements because we have labels for each word and sound, as well as the time intervals during which these events occur.\n\n\nb. Hand-correction\nForced aligners are far from perfect. When a forced aligner creates a text grid, the initial placement of boundaries for words and sounds may not be accurate. During the hand-correction process, researchers manually adjust the boundaries of text grids that have been automatically created using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA). When MFA pairs a transcription with an audio file, it often produces fairly accurate boundary placements. In these cases the boundaries may only need some slight shifting, or even no adjustment at all. Other times, the boundaries are placed at the wrong times, or even when an entirely different word is being produced. These boundaries require hand-correction.\nThe goal of the researcher performing hand-correction is to ensure proper boundary placement. This guide is intended to help visually identify alignment issues by looking at spectrograms and waveforms, and is designed to be a guide for decision-making when boundary placement is difficult to determine.\nFigure 3 shows a text grid prior to hand-correction, and Figure 4 shows the same text grid but with black and gold squares overlaid on the image to show where the word boundaries actually are. Figure 5 shows what the text grid looks like after hand-correction.\n\n\nFigure 3 - Force-aligned Text Grid of cowboy boots that has not yet been hand-corrected. The boundaries for cowboy were placed too soon, and boundaries for boots include the -boy part of cowboy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - Force-aligned Text Grid of cowboy boots that has not yet been hand-corrected. Black and gold squares show where the words actually occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Hand-corrected text grid of cowboy boots. We can now see how the boundaries in the text grid line up with where the box shapes indicated that the word were."

    "text": "4. Hand-correction\n\na. Placement of boundaries\n\nWe place boundaries at the beginnings and ends of events. For example, we place a boundary at the beginning and at the end of a sound. In practice, this boundary is often just ever so slightly before the event that we’re marking and ever so slightly after that event. For two continuous events, the end of one sound is normally the beginning of the next sound unless there is a clear pause.\nThe remainder of this document is a guide to boundary placement for different types of sounds, and for different positions in words and utterances. Use the sidebar and search feature to navigate to relevant sections.\n\n\n\nb. How sounds appear on the spectrogram\n\nVowels\nDarker energy - Vowels appear as dark regions of energy with visible pulses as a result of vocal fold vibration.\nFormants - You will generally see line-like regions called formants. Formants are frequency regions that are emphasized by a given vocal tract configuration, and differ from vowel to vowel. The screenshot below shows the word “toys,” with the vowel OY1 highlighted. Note the formant structure and how one of the formants rises as the diphthong changes from /o/ to /i/.\n\n\nFigure 6 - Vowels appear dark on the spectrogram with distinct darker bands called formants.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquids\nThe lateral approximant L often looks similar to vowels, with the highest energy concentrated in lower frequencies. Here L in Figure 10 contrasts against the IY1 and AE1 vowels on either side.\n\n\nFigure 7 - L sometimes appears vowel-like as featured, and sometimes has a grey, “hollow” look, similar to a nasal.\n\n\n\nLike L, the rhotic R looks much like a vowel, but a clearly articulated R will almost always have a third formant that dips down to 3,000 Hz or lower. Notice the transition that the third band makes from AO1 to R in OR below (the red arrow points to it).\n\n\nFigure 8 - R in or. Appears vowel-like but notice the third formant dropping down adjacent to the second formant.\n\n\n\n\n\nNasals\nThe nasals M, N, and NG will show patterns similar to vowels and liquids, but will often have a “hollow” look compared to a vowel, as in the highlighted portion below in the word “make.”\n\n\nFigure 9 - Nasals have similar energy to vowels, but will appear sparse and grey on the spectrogram.\n\n\n\n\n\nFricatives\nFricatives have noise that is generally distributed throughout the frequency spectrum. S, SH, and Z are typically longer and with very apparent noise in higher frequency ranges. TH, DH, F and V are often less pronounced, but if clearly articulated will have visible noise in the spectrogram. They are also generally shorter than S and SH. DH sometimes appears similar to D.\n\n\nFigure 10 - Fricatives are generally long sounds that appear as noise in the spectrogram.\n\n\n\n\n\nStops\nThe stop sounds P, T, K, B, D, and G will often be characterized by a thin dark line across the frequency range. This is from the release of the consonant (the “burst”). Voiceless stops in English will have a longer period of noisy energy after the burst, and for voiced consonants, the vowel will usually start immediately after the burst.\n\n\nFigure 11 - Stop consonants articulated as such will have a burst which appears as a brief dark band spanning the frequency range. P, T, and K in the onset position of most words will have aspiration that follows."

Consonant-to-vowel transitions within a word\n\nCanonical placement – Place boundary at the clearest vertical onset of formant structure\nWhat this looks like in context\n\nFigure 45 – Consonant to vowel transition boundary placement in context\nWhat this looks like zoomed in\n\nFigure 46 – Consonant to vowel transition boundary placement in context\n\n\n\nb. Consonant-to-vowel transitions across word boundaries\n\nConsonant to vowel transition with a gap between words\n\nQ: Where to place boundaries when there is a visible gap between a final consonant of one word and an initial vowel of the following word?\nA: If there is a visible gap with no audible vowel sound, there should be a pause between the final consonant of the first word and the initial vowel of the following word. As in figure 45 below\n\nFigure 47 - Small gap between final consonant in jump and initial vowel in over.\n\n\n\nConsonant-to-vowel boundaries with no pause\n\nQ: There is sort of a pause between the final consonant of a word and the initial vowel of the following word, but I can hear the vowel starting , just not fully going yet. Should there be a pause?\nA: No, if you can hear the vowel starting to go right after the consonant, even if the vowel isn’t fully going yet, count this as part of the vowel. See figure 46 below.\n\nFigure 48 - What appeared to be a pause between D and A01 actually has audible/visible information as the vowel is starting. In this case, the beginning of the vowel should be the beginning of this information.\n\n\n\nPotential issues\n\nWhen there’s a “notch” of voicing preceding formant structure and phonation\n\nQ: Do we include the little “notch” of voicing as the beginning of the vowel, or start at formant structure? MFA wants to include the notch.\nA: We are not going to include the notch. Start vowel when formants start\nFigure 49 – Boundary placement when there is “notch” of voice bar that precedes formant structure in a vowel\n\n\n\nVowel starts before phonation\n\nQ: I can hear vowel starting (in OW1 below) before formants actually start. Should there be a pause?\nA: Yes, let’s treat this as articulation, just like the nasal frication instances (see also figure 46 above.\nIn context\n\nFigure 50 – Vowel starts before phonation, viewed in context\nZoomed in:\n\nFigure 51 – Vowel starts before phonation, zoomed in\n\n\n\nVoiceless vowels\n\nQ: When first vowel in “potato” is voiceless, what do we count as vowel?\nA: Look for most vowely part that doesn’t seem to be aspiration.\nIn context:\n\nFigure 52 – Voiceless vowel in “potato”, viewed in context\nZoomed in:\n\nFigure 53 – Voiceless vowel in “potato”, zoomed in\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Consonant-to-consonant transitions\n\nFricative to stop/affricate transitions\n\nQ: Where to put the boundary when there is a transition from a fricative to a stop or affricate?\nA: The boundary between a fricative and a stop should be placed at the end of the fricative. There may be a small “silent” period before the stop, which is the closure duration of the stop/affricate, and not actually a pause.\n\nFigure 54 – Boundary placement in Fricative &gt; Stop/Affricate transitions. Here between S of THIS and CH of CHEESE.\n\n\n\nFricative to fricative transitions\n\nQ: Where to put the boundary between two fricatives?\nA: Look for a shift in the appearance of the noise for the two fricatives. The example below shows the transition from Z in IS to SH in SHOWING.\n\nFigure 55 – Fricative to fricative transition. Here there is some noise across the frequency range before, or perhaps as part of the transition to SH, which shows a different noise pattern. This lets us see the shift from Z to SH.\n\n\n\nStop to fricative transitions\n\nQ: Where do we place the boundary between consecutive stops and fricatives (e.g., the boundary between T and S in “cowboy boots”).\nA: Fricatives will almost always start immediately after the burst release, especially if the fricative and stop\nIn context:\n\nFigure 56 – Stop to fricative boundary in BOOTS\nZoomed in:\n\nFigure 57 – T &gt; S boundary, zoomed in\n\n\n\nWhen to start HH in C|HH transitions\n\nQ: When do we begin the HH when transitioning from a stop (e.g., “D” below”)?\nA: Look for the transition from burst to HH. HH usually starts to have more formant structure.\n\nFigure 58 – When to start HH in consonant-to-consonant transition\nWhat this looks like zoomed in:\n\nFigure 59 - D|HH boundary, zoomed in\n\n\n\nStop to stop transitions (across word boundaries)\n\nQ: Where to place boundaries between stop consonants when there is a word boundary?\nA: If the first stop is released, place the boundary after the release of the first stop and at the beginning of the closure for the second stop (see figures below).\nIf the stop is unreleased, see the next section.\nIn context:\n\nFigure 60 – Cursor is at boundary between G and D\nZoomed in:\n\nFigure 61 – Boundary between G and D is placed after release of G and when amplitude in signal reduces as closure for D begins.\n\n\n\nUnreleased Cons to Cons transition\n\nQ: Where do we place the boundary if final consonants are unreleased like in “hug daddy”?\nA: If boundary for 1st consonant is placed at least 50 ms before the burst of the 2nd consonant, the boundary placement is okay. In the example below, the boundary was placed less than 50 ms before the 2nd consonant, so the boundary was moved to 50 ms preceding the consonant\nPre-correction\n\nFigure 62 – Boundary placement in unreleased consonants, at least 50 ms before release of 2nd consonant (pre-correction)\nPost-correction:\n\nFigure 63 – Boundary for unreleased consonant was moved to 50ms preceding 2nd consonant.\nThis boundary between G and D would remain where it is because MFA already placed it more than 50 ms prior to the release of D.\n\nFigure 64 – Consonant to consonant, unreleased, no correction required.\nQ: Where do we place the boundary when the gap between two consonants doesn’t allow for 50ms before the second consonant?\nA: Place the boundary for the end of the first consonant/beginning of the second consonant in the most reasonable place given what you can see/hear.\nThe boundary between D and DH in figure X below is not placed 50ms before the release of DH, but it’s placed after a relatively clear ending of D, and the audio supported the placement of this boundary.\n\n\n\nFigure 65 - Boundary placement between D and DH when less than 50ms available before DH\n\n\n\nPause between words, when do we start the post-pausal consonant?\n\nQ: When there is a pause between words, are we doing a bit of space before a within-sentence onset consonant?\nA: Place boundary 50 ms before beginning of the post-pausal consonant (cf Trouvain & Werner, 2022).\n\nFigure 66 – Within utterance pause before a stop consonant. Initial, post-pausal boundary for consonant should be placed 50 ms before release of stop consonant.\n\n\n\n\nd. Vowel-to-vowel boundaries\n\nWhere to place boundary in continuous V|V transitions\n\nQ: Where should we place the boundary between vowels when there is no pause?\nA: Using the visual of the spectrogram as well as what you can hear, look for the border between the two vowels. See “She is…” below, where there is no break between the words and the vowels are sequential and continuous.\n\nFigure 67 – Vowel to vowel transition with no pause\nZoomed in:\n\nFigure 68 – the vertical cursor line shows the transition from IY1 in “she” to IH0 in “is”. Note how the second formant lowers going from IY1 to IH0 (you can see where the dotted red lines cross on the spectrogram).\n\n\n\nWhere to place boundary in V|V transitions with a pause between words\n\nQ: Should we place a pause between V# #V word boundaries when there is a brief pause and no visible/audible information?\nA: These should have a pause between them since vowels do not have the same articulatory closure periods that consonants have. Final boundary of the preceding vowel should end at the end of information from that vowel, and initial boundary of the following initial vowel should start at the beginning of audible/visible information related to that vowel.\n\nFigure 69 - Pause between vowels\n\n\n\n\ne. Vowel-to-voiceless consonant transitions\n\nCanonical placement – place end-of-vowel boundary where formant structure and phonation cease. This sometimes precedes the burst of the consonant by what appears to be significant amounts. See below for instances when there is pre-aspiration adjacent to the vowel and preceding the consonant.\nWhat this looks like in context - “make a birdhouse”\n\nFigure 70 - Transition from a vowel to a following voiceless consonant\nZoomed in, one can see a bit of residual phonation in black at the bottom of the spectrogram that continues into the K, but because the formant structure and associated noise in the middle frequencies shuts off about here, this is where we put the boundary.\n\nFigure 71 - Zoomed in on end of vowel and transition into K\n\n\nVowel-to-Consonant with preaspiration\n\nQ: In “coffee”, do we attribute the voiceless vowel portion to the vowel or to the consonant as part of transition to [f]? If we’re treating it like a stop, this would be consonant closure, but do we treat fricatives the same?\nA: We are going to treat this as part of the consonant. Phonation is shutting off due to laryngeal status of following consonant.\nNote that this makes boundary placement in vowel &gt; consonant transitions completely analogous to many transitions from voiceless consonants to vowels (e.g. when there is heavy aspiration on a sound like K, but we start the vowel at onset of phonation for the vowel, even though the vocal tract may already be positioned for the vowel during the aspiration).\n\nFigure 72 - Here the phonation of the vowel ends suddenly as the glottis positions for S, resulting in H-like pre-aspiration leading into the F\n\n\n\n\nf. Vowel to voiced consonant transitions\n\nCanonical placement – place boundary at the end of the vowel where you will typically see a sudden reduction in energy in the spectrogram (goes from near-black to lighter grey) as well as a shift in formant structure.\nWhat this looks like in context:\n\nFigure 73 – Vowel to voiced consonant transition in context\nWhat this looks like zoomed in\n\nFigure 74 – vowel to voiced consonant transition, zoomed\nThere can be varying degrees of voicing between when the vowel ends and the consonant is released. The first, canonical examples shows when voicing goes entirely through the consonant closure. The following example shows partial voicing through consonant closure:\nIn context:\n\nFigure 75 - Contextual view of a coda consonant closure with only partial voicing during the closure.\nZoomed in:\n\nFigure 76 - Closer view of partial voicing during consonant closure\n\n\nPotential issues: Vowel-to-voiced consonant transitions\n\nWhere to put boundary when there is a gap in phonation between a vowel and a consonant.\nQ: When there’s a gap between end of vowel and beginning of fricative?\nA: Count it towards the fricative and mark the end of the vowel as the end of the vowel.\n\nFigure 77 – Vowel to fricative transition, voicing stops before articulation of consonant\nWhen to end a vowel when voicing is inconsistent\nQ: When voicing isn’t consistently modal, how do we decide when a vowel actually ends? (in other instances, we would end the vowel with voicing).\nA: Look for end of formant structure. There should still be formant structure even without phonation.\n\nFigure 78 – Vowel to consonant transition, inconsistent phonation of vowel\n\n\n\n\ng. Pauses\n\nPauses from consonant to vowel across word boundaries\n\nSometimes transitions from consonants to vowels across word boundaries are continuous, and there is no break between words. At other times there is a visible break with no audible or visible information between the consonant and the vowel. There should be a break between words in these instances:\n\nFigure 79 - Break between consonant and vowel across word boundaries\n\n\n\nPauses from vowel to vowel across word boundaries\n\nSimilarly, sometimes there is a break between two vowels that are on either side of a word boundary. If there is a break with no audible or visible information between the vowels, this break should be reflected with a break between words and phones in the text grid.\n\nFigure 80 - Pause between vowels\n\n\n\nChild holds a pause and phonation keeps going\n\nQ: When a child is holding a pause with voice going, is this counted as “speech”?\nA: Seems like inserting a pause here might be best, as it’s not just prolonged coarticulation between two segments.\n\nFigure 81 – Pause with phonation"

Consonant-to-vowel transitions across words\n\nConsonant to vowel transition with a gap between words\n\nQ: Where to place boundaries when there is a visible gap between a final consonant of one word and an initial vowel of the following word?\n\nA: If there is a visible gap with no audible vowel sound, there should be a pause between the final consonant of the first word and the initial vowel of the following word. As in figure 41 below\n\n\n\n\nFigure 41 - Small gap between final consonant in “jump” and initial vowel in “over”.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsonant-to-vowel boundaries with no pause\n\nQ: There is sort of a pause between the final consonant of a word and the initial vowel of the following word, but I can hear the vowel starting , just not fully going yet. Should there be a pause?\n\nA: No, if you can hear the vowel starting to go right after the consonant, even if the vowel isn’t fully going yet, count this as part of the vowel. See figure 42 below.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 42 - What appeared to be a pause between D and A01 actually has audible/visible information as the vowel is starting. In this case, the beginning of the vowel should be the beginning of this information.\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential issues\n\nWhen there’s a “notch” of voicing preceding formant structure and phonation\n\nQ: Do we include the little “notch” of voicing as the beginning of the vowel, or start at formant structure? MFA wants to include the notch.\n\nA: We are not going to include the notch. Start vowel when formants start.\n\n\n\nFigure 43 - Boundary placement when there is “notch” of voice bar that precedes formant structure in a vowel.\n\n\n\n\n\nVowel starts before phonation\n\nQ: I can hear vowel starting (in OW1 below) before formants actually start. Should there be a pause?\n\nA: Yes, include a pause. Anything before phonation and formant structure should not be a part of the vowel interval. The figures below show how MFA sometimes aligns these vowels but this pre-phonation area should be a part of the preceding pause.\n\nIn context:\n\n\n\nFigure 44 - Vowel starts before phonation, viewed in context.\n\n\n\nZoomed in:\n\n\n\nFigure 45 - Vowel starts before phonation, zoomed in.\n\n\n\n\n\nVoiceless vowels\n\nQ: When the first vowel in a word such as “potato” is voiceless, what do we count as vowel?\n\nA: Look for the part that is most similar to a vowel that doesn’t seem to be aspiration.\n\n\nIn context:\n\n\n\nFigure 46 - Voiceless vowel in “potato,” viewed in context.\n\n\n\nZoomed in:\n\n\n\nFigure 47 - Voiceless vowel in “potato,” zoomed in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nc. Consonant-to-consonant transitions\n\nFricative to stop/affricate transitions\n\nQ: Where to put the boundary when there is a transition from a fricative to a stop or affricate?\n\nA: The boundary between a fricative and a stop should be placed at the end of the fricative. There may be a small “silent” period before the stop, which is the closure duration of the stop/affricate, and not actually a pause.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 48 - Boundary placement in Fricative &gt; Stop/Affricate transitions. Here between S of “this” and CH of “cheese.”\n\n\n\n\n\nFricative to fricative transitions\n\nQ: Where to put the boundary between two fricatives?\n\nA: Look for a shift in the appearance of the noise for the two fricatives. The example below shows the transition from Z in “is” to SH in “showing.”\n\n\n\n\nFigure 49 - Fricative to fricative transition. Here there is some noise across the frequency range before, or perhaps as part of the transition to SH, which shows a different noise pattern.

Vowel-to-voiceless consonant transitions\n\nCanonical placement – place end-of-vowel boundary where formant structure and phonation cease. This sometimes precedes the burst of the consonant by what appears to be significant amounts. See below for instances when there is pre-aspiration adjacent to the vowel and preceding the consonant.\nWhat this looks like in context - “make a birdhouse”\n\nFigure 70 - Transition from a vowel to a following voiceless consonant\nZoomed in, one can see a bit of residual phonation in black at the bottom of the spectrogram that continues into the K, but because the formant structure and associated noise in the middle frequencies shuts off about here, this is where we put the boundary.\n\nFigure 71 - Zoomed in on end of vowel and transition into K\n\n\nVowel-to-Consonant with preaspiration\n\nQ: In “coffee”, do we attribute the voiceless vowel portion to the vowel or to the consonant as part of transition to [f]? If we’re treating it like a stop, this would be consonant closure, but do we treat fricatives the same?\nA: We are going to treat this as part of the consonant. Phonation is shutting off due to laryngeal status of following consonant.\nNote that this makes boundary placement in vowel &gt; consonant transitions completely analogous to many transitions from voiceless consonants to vowels (e.g. when there is heavy aspiration on a sound like K, but we start the vowel at onset of phonation for the vowel, even though the vocal tract may already be positioned for the vowel during the aspiration).\n\nFigure 72 - Here the phonation of the vowel ends suddenly as the glottis positions for S, resulting in H-like pre-aspiration leading into the F\n\n\n\n\nf. Vowel to voiced consonant transitions\n\nCanonical placement – place boundary at the end of the vowel where you will typically see a sudden reduction in energy in the spectrogram (goes from near-black to lighter grey) as well as a shift in formant structure.\nWhat this looks like in context:\n\nFigure 73 – Vowel to voiced consonant transition in context\nWhat this looks like zoomed in\n\nFigure 74 – vowel to voiced consonant transition, zoomed\nThere can be varying degrees of voicing between when the vowel ends and the consonant is released. The first, canonical examples shows when voicing goes entirely through the consonant closure. The following example shows partial voicing through consonant closure:\nIn context:\n\nFigure 75 - Contextual view of a coda consonant closure with only partial voicing during the closure.\nZoomed in:\n\nFigure 76 - Closer view of partial voicing during consonant closure\n\n\nPotential issues: Vowel-to-voiced consonant transitions\n\nWhere to put boundary when there is a gap in phonation between a vowel and a consonant.\nQ: When there’s a gap between end of vowel and beginning of fricative?\nA: Count it towards the fricative and mark the end of the vowel as the end of the vowel.\n\nFigure 77 – Vowel to fricative transition, voicing stops before articulation of consonant\nWhen to end a vowel when voicing is inconsistent\nQ: When voicing isn’t consistently modal, how do we decide when a vowel actually ends? (in other instances, we would end the vowel with voicing).\nA: Look for end of formant structure. There should still be formant structure even without phonation.\n\nFigure 78 – Vowel to consonant transition, inconsistent phonation of vowel\n\n\n\n\ng. Pauses\n\nPauses from consonant to vowel across word boundaries\n\nSometimes transitions from consonants to vowels across word boundaries are continuous, and there is no break between words. At other times there is a visible break with no audible or visible information between the consonant and the vowel. There should be a break between words in these instances:\n\nFigure 79 - Break between consonant and vowel across word boundaries\n\n\n\nPauses from vowel to vowel across word boundaries\n\nSimilarly, sometimes there is a break between two vowels that are on either side of a word boundary. If there is a break with no audible or visible information between the vowels, this break should be reflected with a break between words and phones in the text grid.\n\nFigure 80 - Pause between vowels\n\n\n\nChild holds a pause and phonation keeps going\n\nQ: When a child is holding a pause with voice going, is this counted as “speech”?\nA: Seems like inserting a pause here might be best, as it’s not just prolonged coarticulation between two segments.\n\nFigure 81 – Pause with phonation"

Blend coalescence\n\nSM coalesces to F\n\nQ: For coalescences: Do we treat one as “deleted” (“to fall fieces”)? How do we space them?\nA: Let the two segments (S and M below) have a relatively equal amount of the segment.\n\nFigure 99 – Segment boundaries when segments are coalesced\n\n\n\n\nb. Vocalization of L and Syllabic L\n\nFinal L is produced as OW1 (“animo”)\n\nQ: When we’ve got /l/ as /o/ at the end of a word, what counts as AH0 and L?\nA: Luke’s initial response would be that it should all count as L. Make AH0 small, and L longer because the target production would primarily be L.\n\nFigure 100 – Vocalic L (pronounced as /o/) should have very short AH0 segment, L should make up nearly all of the sound.\n\n\n\nWhere to place L boundaries in AH0 L sequence when L is syllabic\n\nQ: syllabic L (can we justify “AH0 L” pronunciations over “L”? “soccer” has S AA1 K ER0, for instance).\nA: We need to keep these due to the adult models and assumed pronunciations. If it’s a syllabic L, just make AH0 shorter.\n\nFigure 101 – Syllabic L, if there is no vowel to be heard between M and L in animal, AH0 should be minimal and L should take up nearly the entire duration of the sound.\n\n\n\n\nc. Syllabic R issues\n\nWhere to place boundaries and whether to keep segments when R is syllabic\n\nQ: Change pronunciation from ”R” to “AA1|R”\nA: Luke’s initial response, syllabic R happens in these positions. Or just make AA1 very small.\n\nFigure 102 - Syllabic R"

Over-arching principles\nWhile the remainder of this guide shows specific examples of where boundaries should be placed in certain circumstances, there are a few overarching principles to keep in mind. These should be used in conjunction with the remainder of the guide to make more efficient decisions regarding boundary placement.\n\nWhat counts as speech?\nWe’re counting as speech any sound generated by the articulators that carries information about the sounds produced in the utterance.\nWhen should a boundary be moved?\nBoundaries should remain where they were placed by the forced aligner unless you have visual or auditory evidence that a given boundary does not line up with the beginning or end of a sound. Minimizing unnecessary movements promotes consistency across alignments."
