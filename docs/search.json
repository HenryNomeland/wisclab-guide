    "text": "a. Forced alignment and text grids\n\n\n\nFigure 1 - Visual of how hand-correction of text grids relates to other lab tasks\n\n\nIn the WISC Lab we have audio recordings of children with typical speech development and with speech and motor impairments due to Cerebral Palsy. In these recordings the child is repeating words and phrases from the Test of Children’s Speech (the TOCS, as we know them by). Examples include phrases like “Cowboy boots” and “Put all the toys away”. We then use the recordings of these phrases to calculate articulation rate, speech sound accuracy, as well as to get measures of how intelligible the child is. Figure 3 below shows what it looks like if we open the file “The sign says keep out” all by itself in the program Praat.\nWe can see the waveform (top) and the spectrogram (bottom), but what if we want to keep track of how long different words and sounds are?\n\n\n\nFigure 2 - Recording of “The sign says keep out” when opened in Praat.\n\n\nMarking the start and end points of sounds and words in a recording is useful for a variety of research purposes. However, we can’t make marks/annotations directly in the sound file, so to do this we need to create a separate file that stores all of the locations of events like the start and end of a word or sound.\nThe tool that we use to create a separate document containing annotations and labels for different words and sounds is called a forced aligner. A forced aligner takes an audio file (typically a .wav file) and a transcription of what was said in the audio file (usually a .txt or .lab file) and uses speech recognition technology to create a new file called a text grid that is designed to be paired with the audio file. The text grid has boundaries and labels indicating the locations of the words and phonemes in the audio file.\nA text grid file is associated with a given audio file and has moveable boundaries and labels to note the occurrence of certain events (like the beginning and end of a vowel) that may be useful for research. Figure 4 below shows what that same audio file (“The sign says keep out”) looks like when opened together with the text grid that was created for that sound file by Montreal Forced Aligner. The text grids we create for the lab contain separate tiers for words, sounds, and the sentence containing them. Each tier has intervals with vertical boundaries separating words and sounds. These files (the text grid and wav file) can be used for automated retrieval of acoustic data such as duration of a word/sound, formant frequencies of vowels, and other variables of interest.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - “The sign says keep out” when the recording is opened together with a fully annotated “text grid”.\n\n\nWe can open these text grids along with the audio file in a program called Praat (Dutch for “speech”, sounds like “praht” - /pra:t/). When the text grids and audio files are paired together in Praat, it is now easier and quicker for us to make measurements because we have labels for each word and sound, as well as the time intervals during which these events occur."

    "text": "b. Hand-correction\nForced aligners are not perfect, however. When a forced aligner creates a text grid, the initial placement of boundaries for words and sounds may not be accurate. During the hand-correction process, you will be adjusting boundaries in text grids that have been automatically created using the Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA for short). When Montreal Forced Aligner pairs a typed transcription with an audio file, it frequently does a pretty good job of putting boundaries in place, and the boundaries might just need some slight shifting, or even no adjustment at all. Other times, the boundaries are placed at the wrong times, and even placed at a time at which an entirely different word is being produced. These boundaries require hand-correction.\nYour job is to ensure that those boundaries have been placed where they ought to go. This document that you are reading now is intended to help you understand what you are looking at when you look at audio recordings in Praat (or any program that shows a spectrogram and waveform), and it is designed to be a guide for decision-making when boundary placement is difficult to determine.\nFigure 5 shows a text grid prior to hand-correction, and Figure 6 shows the same text grid but with black and gold squares overlaid on the image to show where the word boundaries actually are. Figure 7 then shows what the text grid looks like after hand-correction.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - Force-aligned Text Grid of cowboy boots that has not yet been hand-corrected. The boundaries for cowboy were placed too soon, and boundaries for boots include the -boy part of cowboy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Force-aligned Text Grid of cowboy boots that has not yet been hand-corrected. Black and gold squares show where the words actually occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Hand-corrected text grid of cowboy boots. We can now see how the boundaries in the text grid line up with where the box shapes indicated that the word were."

Formants are frequency regions that are emphasized by a given vocal tract configuration, and differ from vowel to vowel. The screenshot below shows the word TOYS, with the vowel OY1 highlighted. Note the formant structure and how one of the formants rises as the diphthong changes from /o/ to /i/.\n\n\nLiquids\nL often looks similar to vowels, with highest energy concentrated in lower frequencies. Here L in Figure 10 contrasts against the IY1 and AE1 vowels on either side.\nR\nLike L, R looks much like a vowel, but a clearly articulated R will almost always have a third formant that dips down to 3,000 Hz or lower. Notice the transition that the third band makes from AO1 to R in OR below (the red arrow points to it).\n\n\nNasals\nNasals will generally show patterns similar to vowels and liquids, but will often have a “hollow” look compared to a vowel, as in the highlighted portion below in the word MAKE.\n\n\nFricatives\nS, SH (sheep), Z, F, V, TH (think), DH (this)\nNoise - Fricatives have noise that is generally distributed throughout the frequency spectrum.\nS, SH, and Z are typically longer and with very apparent noise in higher frequency ranges.\nTH, DH, F and V are often less pronounced, but if clearly articulated will have visible noise in the spectrogram. Generally shorter than S and SH.\nDH sometimes appears similar to D\n\n\nStops\nP, T, K, B, D, G\nBurst – Stops will often be characterized by a thin dark line across the frequency range. This is from the release of the consonant (the “burst”).\nVoiceless stops in English will have a longer period of noisy energy after the burst, and for voiced consonants, the vowel will usually start immediately after the burst."

There may be a small “silent” period before the stop, which is the closure duration of the stop/affricate, and not actually a pause.\n\nFigure 54 – Boundary placement in Fricative &gt; Stop/Affricate transitions.

Phonation is shutting off due to laryngeal status of following consonant.\nNote that this makes boundary placement in vowel &gt; consonant transitions completely analogous to many transitions from voiceless consonants to vowels (e.g. when there is heavy aspiration on a sound like K, but we start the vowel at onset of phonation for the vowel, even though the vocal tract may already be positioned for the vowel during the aspiration).\n\nFigure 72 - Here the phonation of the vowel ends suddenly as the glottis positions for S, resulting in H-like pre-aspiration leading into the F"

The first, canonical examples shows when voicing goes entirely through the consonant closure. The following example shows partial voicing through consonant closure:\nIn context:\n\nFigure 75 - Contextual view of a coda consonant closure with only partial voicing during the closure.\nZoomed in:\n\nFigure 76 - Closer view of partial voicing during consonant closure\n\n\nPotential issues: Vowel-to-voiced consonant transitions\n\nWhere to put boundary when there is a gap in phonation between a vowel and a consonant.\nQ: When there’s a gap between end of vowel and beginning of fricative?\nA: Count it towards the fricative and mark the end of the vowel as the end of the vowel.\n\nFigure 77 – Vowel to fricative transition, voicing stops before articulation of consonant\nWhen to end a vowel when voicing is inconsistent\nQ: When voicing isn’t consistently modal, how do we decide when a vowel actually ends? (in other instances, we would end the vowel with voicing).\nA: Look for end of formant structure. There should still be formant structure even without phonation.\n\nFigure 78 – Vowel to consonant transition, inconsistent phonation of vowel"

Pauses\n\nPauses from consonant to vowel across word boundaries\n\nSometimes transitions from consonants to vowels across word boundaries are continuous, and there is no break between words. At other times there is a visible break with no audible or visible information between the consonant and the vowel. There should be a break between words in these instances:\n\nFigure 79 - Break between consonant and vowel across word boundaries\n\n\n\nPauses from vowel to vowel across word boundaries\n\nSimilarly, sometimes there is a break between two vowels that are on either side of a word boundary. If there is a break with no audible or visible information between the vowels, this break should be reflected with a break between words and phones in the text grid.\n\nFigure 80 - Pause between vowels\n\n\n\nChild holds a pause and phonation keeps going\n\nQ: When a child is holding a pause with voice going, is this counted as “speech”?\nA: Seems like inserting a pause here might be best, as it’s not just prolonged coarticulation between two segments.\n\nFigure 81 – Pause with phonation"
